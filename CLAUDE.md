# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Project guidance lives in @AGENTS.md — commands, architecture, conventions and the RozdzielnicaPro
domain rules. Read it first; this file only adds what is specific to Claude Code.

## 10xDevs toolkit

This repo is also a 10xDevs AI Toolkit workspace. The full lesson text — chain diagram, task router,
the inclusion test, the five-pattern calibration drill — is preserved at @docs/10x-toolkit.md.

Skill chain:

```
/10x-init → /10x-shape → /10x-prd → /10x-tech-stack-selector → /10x-bootstrapper
          → /10x-agents-md → /10x-rule-review → /10x-lesson
```

**Never write to `context/archive/`.** Archived changes are immutable — if a resolved target path
starts with `context/archive/`, stop and say: "This change is archived. Open a new change with
`/10x-new` instead."

## Rules-for-AI hygiene

Before adding a rule here or to `AGENTS.md`, apply the inclusion test: _could an agent that already
knows TypeScript, Astro and Supabase figure this out without being told?_ If yes, drop it. Keep
project-specific conventions, traps and workarounds; reference canonical files with `@`-paths rather
than pasting their contents. Most important rules go at the top — attention is weakest in the middle
of a long file. Per-area rules belong in a nested `AGENTS.md` next to the code they govern.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 2

Turn one roadmap item into the first implementation cycle with the **change planning chain**:

```
/10x-roadmap -> /10x-new -> /10x-plan -> /10x-plan-review -> /10x-implement
```

`/10x-new`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, and `/10x-implement` are the lesson focus. `/10x-frame` and `/10x-research` are not required rituals here; they are escalation paths introduced in the next lesson.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill                                  | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change setup (lesson focus)**        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-new <change-id>`                 | You selected a roadmap item and need a stable change folder. Creates `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` so planning, implementation, progress, commits, and later review all share one identity. Use AFTER roadmap selection, BEFORE `/10x-plan`.               |
| **Planning (lesson focus)**            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>`                | You have a change folder and need a reviewable implementation plan. Reads roadmap context, foundation docs, codebase evidence, and any existing change notes; writes `plan.md` and `plan-brief.md` with phases, file contracts, success criteria, and `## Progress`. |
| **Plan readiness (lesson focus)**      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-plan-review <change-id>`         | You have `plan.md` and need a light pre-code readiness check. Use it to catch missing end state, weak contracts, malformed progress, scope drift, or blind spots before code changes begin.                                                                          |
| **Implementation (lesson focus)**      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | You have an approved plan and want to execute one phase with verification, manual gate, commit ritual, and SHA write-back to `## Progress`.                                                                                                                          |
| **Lifecycle closure**                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-archive <change-id>`             | A change is merged or intentionally closed. Move it out of active `context/changes/` into archive state.                                                                                                                                                             |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-new` creates the durable change identity.
- `/10x-plan` turns that identity into an implementation contract.
- `/10x-plan-review` checks the plan before the agent mutates code.
- `/10x-implement` executes one planned phase, verifies, asks for manual confirmation when needed, commits, and records progress.

### Lesson boundaries

- Plan is the default router after roadmap selection. Start with `/10x-plan` unless the problem is unclear or external evidence is blocking.
- Do not run `/10x-frame + /10x-research` as ceremony for every change.
- Do not turn this lesson into a full end-to-end product build. A checkpoint with a planned and partially or fully implemented stream is valid.
- Code review of the implemented diff belongs to Lesson 3 via `/10x-impl-review`.
- Lifecycle closure via `/10x-archive` after a change is merged or intentionally closed.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - upstream roadmap
- `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` - change identity
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan-brief.md` - compressed handoff
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
