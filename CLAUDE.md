# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Project guidance lives in @AGENTS.md — commands, architecture, conventions and the RozdzielnicaPro
domain rules. Read it first; this file only adds what is specific to Claude Code.

## 10xDevs toolkit

This repo is also a 10xDevs AI Toolkit workspace. The full lesson text — chain diagram, task router,
the inclusion test, the five-pattern calibration drill — is preserved at @docs/10x-toolkit.md.

Skill chain:

```
/10x-init → /10x-shape → /10x-prd → /10x-tech-stack-selector → /10x-bootstrapper
          → /10x-agents-md → /10x-rule-review → /10x-lesson
```

**Never write to `context/archive/`.** Archived changes are immutable — if a resolved target path
starts with `context/archive/`, stop and say: "This change is archived. Open a new change with
`/10x-new` instead."

## Rules-for-AI hygiene

Before adding a rule here or to `AGENTS.md`, apply the inclusion test: _could an agent that already
knows TypeScript, Astro and Supabase figure this out without being told?_ If yes, drop it. Keep
project-specific conventions, traps and workarounds; reference canonical files with `@`-paths rather
than pasting their contents. Most important rules go at the top — attention is weakest in the middle
of a long file. Per-area rules belong in a nested `AGENTS.md` next to the code they govern.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill                          | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome**   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `/10x-lesson`                  | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note.                                                                             |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
